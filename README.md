# Interaction-Factor-IJ-plugin

This ImageJ plugin provides a method for quantifying protein-protein interactions by using stochastic modeling
of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy data (RGB images). The result is an unbiased measure
of co-localization of protein clusters, independent of cluster density and comparable across images.
Please refer to [manuscript](http://rdcu.be/xZEI) for a detailed description of the Interaction Factor.
