# Interaction-Factor-IJ-plugin

This plugin provides a method for quantifying protein-protein interactions by using stochastic modeling
of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy data (RGB images). The result is an unbiased measure
of co-localization of protein clusters, independent of cluster density and comparable across images.
Please refer to [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/17/177063) for a detailed description of the Interaction Factor.
